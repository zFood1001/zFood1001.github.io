About Me

<p align="center"> Hi, I'm Rachel Joh. I'm currently a rising sophomore at Stuyvesant High School. I was born on March 20, 2003 in Brooklyn, NY where I've lived my whole life. Before attending Stuyvesant High School, I attended W.A. Cunningham IS.234.

My Interests
<p align="center">
 In my free time, I play video games, embroider, fight with my sister, nap, and hang out with friends. I'm an avid member of Stuyvesant's Key Club and am in charge of creating the monthly locksmith that comes out. 
I really like Samanco Ice Cream <3
